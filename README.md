# tensorflow-tutorial
A brief tensor flow tutorial written by a beginner for beginners

I have been using tensorflow for a year. I might not be an experienced user, but I think I can still write something down
to make others learn this powerful framework easier.

I really think that _Get it dirty and get it work_ is the most important point when one starts to learn something new.
Therefore, I provide more codes than words.

If you think that my codes are useful, just copy and use them.
If you happen to find some bugs or you have better solution than mine, feel free to contact me.

Thanks
